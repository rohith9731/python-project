🧠 Glaucoma Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting Glaucoma from retinal fundus images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model developed in TensorFlow & Keras. The system analyzes the optic nerve head region and classifies whether the eye is affected by glaucoma or not.

📌 Project Overview

Built using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and Pillow

Trained on a dataset of retinal fundus images

Uses image preprocessing, data augmentation, and CNN classification

Implemented and executed in Jupyter Notebook

Output includes accuracy, loss graphs and prediction results
